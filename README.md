# Polynomial Regression Model Exploration

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, using polynomial regression models of varying degrees. It involves feature engineering, model training, and performance analysis using R2 scores.

## Features
- Generation of synthetic data points.
- Feature engineering by adding polynomial features of different degrees.
- Training Linear Regression models with polynomial features.
- Evaluating model performance using R2 score.
- Visualizing training, test data, and model predictions.
- Analysis of overfitting, well-generalization, and underfitting based on R2 scores.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Installation
To install the required Python libraries, run the following command:
